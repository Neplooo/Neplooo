<h2>G'Day 👋</h2>

<p>My name is Alberto - I'm a high school student with a focus on engineering and computer science! I am currently interested in robotics, software development, mechanical design, and data science. During the conventional school year, you will find me focused on the competitive robotics season; however, I am involved in many different projects throughout the summer.</p>
